# ErrorProne Java Project
This project demonstrates the use of the ErrorProne plugin in a Java project to catch common programming errors at compile time. ErrorProne is a static analysis tool that helps identify and prevent potential issues in your code.


ErrorProne is a powerful tool for improving code quality by detecting and preventing common programming mistakes. This project includes examples of code snippets that might result in runtime errors or unintended behavior. By using ErrorProne, these issues can be identified during the compilation process, allowing developers to address them early in the development lifecycle.
